         <h2>How To Play</h2>
      
      <p> What Are The Odds is a simple game intended to make your friends do stupid things.  There are no winners, just losers. </p>

       <p> </p>

      <p>If you aren’t familiar with the game…</p>

       <p> </p>

      <p>   Start by thinking of a challenge or dare you would like to see you friends do.  Once you have something particularly funny or cruel ask your friend “What are the odds you do….(the challenge).  The person dared than has to respond with odds between 1 and 50.  Ex. 1/50, 1/25, 1/10. </p>

      <p>Now each player “secretly” picks a number between 1 and x and plug it in to the web application.   Hit play and the computer will decide your fate.  If the numbers are the same the, the person dared has to complete the dare.  If the numbers are different than nothing happens....unless both number add up to the odds chosen. Then the person that asked the dare has to complete the challenge.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p>There is one special rule.  If the odds chosen are 1/2 than it is guaranteed that one person will have to complete the dare. If the numbers chosen are the same the dare has to do it. If the numbers chosen are different than the darer has to complete the dare.</p>
        
      <h3>Example Game</h3>

      <p> </p>

      <p>Here is an example to inspire the mischief.  Mikey asks John, “What are the Odds you eat that whole box of donuts?”  John responds back 1 in 10.  Mikey inputs the number 4.  John inputs the number 4.  The computer spits back…”John lost (because the numbers are the same) and has to eat that whole box of donuts.”</p>
